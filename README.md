# Les Sons en Français

Les Sons en Français is an Android app to learn sounds in French. I
made  it for  my daughter  which is  currently learning  to read,  but
struggles to remember  what sound is making such  and such combination
of letters.

## How to use it

Select a sound in the list and try  to read the card on the top of the
screen.  Touch the  middle  of the  screen  to hear  how  to read  the
card. Navigate  among cards with the  two arrows on the  bottom of the
screen.

## Choice of the sounds and card order

I follow the same order of  the lecture class from the "Association of
French-Japanese   Families  in   Japan"   (Association  des   Familles
Franco-Japonaises au Japon, AFFJJ).

## IDE

I use Android Studio to develop this app. This repo contains the file project.

## License

This app is under the term of the GNU GPL v3 license.
