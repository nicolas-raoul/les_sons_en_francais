Les Sons en  Fran√ßais is an Android  app to learn sounds  in French. I
made  it for  my daughter  which is  currently learning  to read,  but
struggles to remember  what sound is making such  and such combination
of letters.

## How to use it

Try to read the card on the top of the screen. Touch the middle of the
screen to hear how to read the card. Navigate among cards with the two
arrows on the bottom of the screen.

## Choice of the sounds and card order

I follow the same order of  the lecture class from the "Association of
French-Japanese   Families  in   Japan"   (Association  des   Familles
Franco-Japonaises au Japon, AFFJJ).

## IDE

I use Android Studio to develop this app. This repo contains the file project.

## License

This app is under the term of the GNU GPL v3 license.
