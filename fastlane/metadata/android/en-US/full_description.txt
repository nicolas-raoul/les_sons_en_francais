<p>This application was developed for my daughter at the very beginning of her learning to read in French, outside the school program in France. Being able to repeat the sounds helped her, and I thought it might be useful for other parents.</p>

<p>The order of the sounds is by increasing complexity, as it is taught in the reading workshops of the Association of Franco-Japanese Families in Japan.</p>

<p>The application is free, without advertising, without access to phone data, does not require any special authorization, and is open source under the GNU GPL v3 license. The source code can be found on its GitHub page: https://github.com/richoux/les_sons_en_francais</p>
